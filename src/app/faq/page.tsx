      questions: [
        {
          q: "Do you offer free consultations?",
          a: "Yes! All consultations are completely free. We believe in taking time to understand your vision before any commitment. Consultations include design discussion, placement guidance, size recommendations, and pricing estimates."

          q: "How do I book an appointment?",
          a: "You can book through our online form, call (240) 758-3226, or visit during walk-in hours (Thursday-Sunday 12PM-6PM). We recommend calling ahead to ensure availability, especially for larger pieces."

        {
          q: "What's your availability for DMV area clients?",

        },
        {
          q: "How far in advance should I book?",
          a: "For custom work, we typically book 1-3 weeks out. Smaller pieces or touch-ups may have same-week availability. Holiday seasons book faster, so plan accordingly."

        {
          q: "Do you take walk-ins?",
          a: "Yes, walk-in consultations are welcome during business hours. However, same-day tattoo work depends on availability and complexity. We always recommend calling ahead."

          q: "What's the minimum age requirement?",
          a: "Must be 18+ to get tattooed. NO EXCEPTIONS! Valid government-issued ID is required for all appointments. We strictly follow Maryland state laws regarding tattoo age requirements."

        },
        {
          q: "Any scheduling tips for the best experience?",
          a: "Book 2-4 weeks in advance. Walk-ins welcome but appointments take priority. Arrive on time for your session. Avoid alcohol and aspirin 24 hours before your appointment."

        {
          q: "What happens if I don't show up?",
          a: "No Call - No Show = Loss of deposit. Some larger tattoos may require larger deposits. We respect your time, and ask that you respect ours by providing adequate notice for changes."
        },
        {
          q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
          a: "Cash (all prices based on cash payment), Credit Cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), and Apple Pay for quick and secure mobile payment. Balance is due on completion of your tattoo session."

          q: "Do you offer payment plans for larger tattoos?",
          a: "For larger pieces that require multiple sessions, we can work out a payment schedule.

        },
        {
          q: "How long does the tattoo process take from consultation to completion?",

      title: "Design & Artistic Process",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Do you create custom designs?",
          a: "Absolutely! Every piece we create is completely original and tailored to your vision. We don't use generic flash or copy other artists' work. Your tattoo will be unique to you."
        },
        {
          q: "How does the design process work?",
          a: "After our consultation, we develop initial sketches based on your ideas. We'll refine the design through revisions until it's perfect. You'll see the final design before we start tattooing."
        },
        {
          q: "What if I don't know exactly what I want?",
          a: "That's completely normal! We'll work together during consultation to explore ideas, discuss themes, and develop concepts. Many clients come with just a general idea and leave with a perfect design."
        },
        {
          q: "Can you work with reference images?",
          a: "Yes, we love working with inspiration images! We'll use them to understand your style preferences and create original artwork that captures the essence of what you love."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you do cover-ups?",
          a: "Yes! Cover-ups are a specialty. We'll assess your existing tattoo and design new artwork that completely transforms the area. Most cover-ups turn out better than the original tattoo."
        },
        {
          q: "What should I bring to my consultation?",
          a: "Bring any reference images, inspiration photos, or ideas you've collected. Even rough sketches or descriptions help us understand your vision. We'll also discuss placement, sizing, and any personal meaning behind the tattoo. Don't worry if you're not sure about details â€“ that's what the consultation is for!"
        },
        {
          q: "Can you work with existing tattoos for additions or modifications?",
          a: "Absolutely! We specialize in working with existing tattoos whether you want to add elements, create a sleeve, or modify what you have. Each situation is unique, so we'll assess your current work during consultation and discuss the best approach to achieve your goals while maintaining artistic integrity."

        },
        {
          q: "What's your policy on tattoo touch-ups?",
          a: "We offer complimentary touch-ups within the first 6 months if needed, provided you've followed all aftercare instructions.

        },
        {
          q: "What happens if I need to reschedule my appointment?",
          a: "Life happens! We ask for at least 48 hours notice for rescheduling to avoid losing your deposit. Emergency situations are handled case-by-case. We'll work with you to find a new appointment time that works for everyone. Communication is key â€“ just let us know as soon as possible."
